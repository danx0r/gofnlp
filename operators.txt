can we use commas to account for every possible parenthesizaton?

default:
a / (b / (c / d))
a / b / c / d
Alice saw Bob with Charles and David

((a / b) / c) / d
a / b, / c, /d
Alice and Bob, without Charles, met David

(a / b) / (c / d)
a / b, / c / d
Alice and Bob, played Charles and David

a / ((b / c) / d)
a, / b / c, / d
Alice saw Bob and Charles, talking to David

a / (b / ((c / d) / e))
a / b / c / d, / e
Alice thinks Bob saw Charles and David, talking to Emile
WRONG: parses to (a / (b / (c / d))) / e
Alice thinks, Bob saw Charles and David, talking to Emile
WRONG: parses to a / ((b / (c / d)) / e)
break it down:

b / ((c / d) / e)
Bob saw, Charles and David, talking to Emile
a / (b / ((c / d) / e))
Alice thinks, Bob saw, Charles and David, talking to Emile

a / (b / (c / d) / e)
